## Graduate students

### Emma Grover, MESc 2023




### [Harikrishnan Venugopalan Nair Radhamoni](https://environment.yale.edu/profile/harikrishnan-venugopalan-nair-radhamoni)
Hari is a PhD candidate conducting research on how the taxonomic and functional diversity of non-woody (herbaceous) plants vary along gradients of moisture and light in the forests of Western Ghats in India. Currently, he is excited about finding new, efficient methods and protocols to study herbaceous plants and their traits, including field surveys, nursery experiments, and herbarium-based research.



### [Megan Sullivan](https://meganksullivan.weebly.com/), PhD 2023
Megan began working in the lab as an undergraduate at Ohio State. Since then she has worked on plant ecology research in Panama, China, Brazil, and Gabon. Her PhD dissertation research focuses on the how selective logging alters regeneration and thereby changes the composition, structure, and function of seedling, sapling, and mature tree communities in the tropical rain forests of Gabon.
