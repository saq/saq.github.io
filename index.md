### How can over 600 tree species coexist in a single hectare of rain forest?

### Why has dioecy evolved over 100 times in flowering plants, but still only accounts for 6% of species?

### How do climate, biological and socioeconomic factors such as farmer behaviour and preferences influence plant and animal populations on farmland?


Using a range of techniques from greenhouse experiments, long-term censuses, 
literature and herbarium research to large-scale data collection and cutting-edge
statistical modelling, we address just such a variety of pure and applied
questions that are ultimately concerned with population dynamics - how individuals, 
species and communities (including humans) interact over both ecological and evolutionary time.
