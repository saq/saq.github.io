# Data

### our data

We are slowly working to make the data we collect ourselves available. These will be described here, and also linked to from each paper on the [publications](publications.html) page.


### others' data

Much of the work we do uses data from long-term large-scale permanent forest dynamics plots, mostly from the [Center for Tropical Forest Science](http://www.ctfs.si.edu/) (now Smithsonian Institute-Global Earth Observatories). Much of their summary data is open-access, especially that from [BCI](http://www.ctfs.si.edu/group/General%20Information/Datasets).
