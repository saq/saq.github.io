## Graduate students

### Emma Grover, MESc 2023
Emma is investigating variation in leaf traits across a rainfall gradient in the Western Ghats, India, and within the Yasuni forest dynamics plot, Ecuador.



### Harikrishnan Venugopalan Nair Radhamoni, PhD 2023
Hari is a PhD candidate conducting research on how the taxonomic and functional diversity of non-woody (herbaceous) plants vary along gradients of moisture and light in the forests of Western Ghats in India. Currently, he is excited about finding new, efficient methods and protocols to study herbaceous plants and their traits, including field surveys, nursery experiments, and herbarium-based research.
