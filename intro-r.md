This seminar course will provide an introduction to the statistical software environment R, from complete beginner level to more advanced topics. I will assume no prior knowledge of R, but by the end of the course you should be well-equipped to use R for all your data analyses.

The course will cover:
 - getting your data in to R
 - classical statistical tests
 - linear and generalized linear models
 - mixed effects models
 - bayesian approaches

I will also touch on:
 - data presentation
 - best practices for workflow and data management
 - reproducible research

Specialist topics can be provided on request.

R provides an integrated tool for all your data manipulation, visualisation and statistical needs. It produces publication-quality figures, provides the latest cutting-edge statistical tools, has a very active community working on it and in it, leaves a full record of your analyses... and is free!
