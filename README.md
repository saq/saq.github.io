### about this site

The source code for this site can be found on [Github](https://github.com/saq/saq.github.io). The CSS is based on [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), scalable css icons with [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome) and static site generation with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), theme provided by [bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/).

### thanks

[Carl Boettiger](http://carlboettiger.info/) provides a very good [intro to Jekyll](http://carlboettiger.info/2012/12/30/learning-jekyll.html) on his lab notebook.
