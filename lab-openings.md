# Lab Openings

### Current Situation (Fall 2013)

I am **not** currently looking for graduate students.


### Post-docs
I currently have no funding to support post-doctoral researchers. If you are interested in developing a grant proposal, or applying to the OSU Mathematical Biosciences Institute with me as a potential advisor, please get in touch.


### Graduate Students
I am always on the look-out for good students and colleagues. In particular, I seek highly motivated students who take their research interests seriously. I expect students to use their graduate research as the first step on a career that will pursue answers to outstanding questions in plant ecology and evolution. In pursuing these broader goals, I believe an integrative research approach is fundamental. Therefore, I encourage new students to train themselves broadly and to absorb and implement novel techniques. Good quantitative skills are becoming more and more important, but these can be learned.

Facilities in the department are good for conducting lab, greenhouse, field or computer-based approaches.

If you are interested in pursuing graduate work in my lab, please read this page, the department grad pages, some of my publications and my Research page. If your interests overlap sufficiently with mine, please email me with a statement of your research interests and a CV/Resume that gives your educational background (GPA, relevant biology, math and statistics classes), related work/field/lab experience, publications if any, and GRE scores if available. I will get back to you as soon as I can.


### Undergraduate students
I am always looking for sincere, hardworking and motivated undergraduate students to actively participate in research projects or to conduct their own independent research.

After reading this page, if you are interested in gaining practical experience in ecology and evolution and you are interested in the research described on this website, please contact me to discuss possibilities. Please include details of the courses you have taken/are taking, current GPA etc following this resume template.
