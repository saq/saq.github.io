### F&ES 720a Introduction to R

[F&ES page](http://environment.yale.edu/courses/detail/720)
 
Fall, 3 credits 

<p></p>

[Introduction to R](http://intro2r.info) covers basic to advanced programming and statistics in R. This has previously been taught in Ecuador, India, China, and now here ...

The course provides an overview and introduction to the statistical software R for the analysis and graphical presentation of natural and social science data.

### F&ES 717 Tropical Field Ecology

[F&ES page](http://environment.yale.edu/courses/detail/717/)

Spring, 3 credits 

<p></p>


Fifteen days, 15 students, four forests.

Students learn practical scientific skills of experimental design, execution and presentation, basic identification and taxonomy, and experience a number of different cultures and ecosystems, as well as interacting with world-class scientists.

The course is usually co-taught with [Dr. Liza Comita](http://environment.yale.edu/profile/comita) and alternates between Panama and Ecuador.

### F&ES 603 Environmental Data Visualization & Communication

Spring, 3 credits

In this course, you will learn how to effectively explore, identify, and communicate key insights from environmental data to diverse audiences through visualization and presentation. Classes consist of short lectures on key principles of effective communication, data management, and visual design, coupled with discussions, peer critiques, and hands-on visualization activities. Throughout the term, we will introduce a variety of tools (including R, Tableau, Excel) and use these tools to develop and experimentally test alternative visualizations. 

Co-taught with [Dr. Jenn Marlon](https://environment.yale.edu/profile/jennifer-marlon/)


### Dissemination
The science we do must be relevant to society, but to do this it must be communicated well. It is a sad fact that scientific illiteracy is common, but many of the world's problems can be addressed by science and the scientific method. Within academia, this issue can be addressed by high quality training of science students, and I have written a number of resources (Queenborough 2011a,b,c 2012 Bulletin of the British Ecological Society) that discuss various skills such as writing and time management that are often not explicitly taught (these articles, along with a several by other members, will be published by the British Ecological Society as a Handbook).

I am also preparing a number of the case studies that I developed for submission to the [National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science](http://libweb1.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/) as peer-reviewed case studies.
