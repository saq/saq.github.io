# Teaching

### Introduction to R

We teach an [Introduction to R](R/index.html) course, covering basic to advanced programming and statistics in [R](www.r-project.org). This has previously been taught in Ecudaor, India, China and the USA.

This will be taught in Fall 2015: [Announcement](intro-r.html)

Fifteen days, 15 students, four habitat types, one canal.

Students learn practical scientific skills of experimental design, execution and presentation, basic identification and taxonomy, and experience a number of different cultures and ecosystems, as well as interacting with world-class scientists in the [Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute](http://www.stri.si.edu/).

### Dissemination
The science we do must be relevant to society, but to do this it must be communicated well. It is a sad fact that scientific illiteracy is common, but many of the world's problems can be addressed by science and the scientific method. Within academia, this issue can be addressed by high quality training of science students, and I have written a number of resources (Queenborough 2011a,b,c 2012 Bulletin of the British Ecological Society) that discuss various skills such as writing and time management that are often not explicitly taught (these articles, along with a several by other members, will be published by the British Ecological Society as a Handbook).

I am also preparing a number of the case studies that I developed for submission to the [National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science](http://libweb1.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/) as peer-reviewed case studies.
