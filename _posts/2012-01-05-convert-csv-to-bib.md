# Convert .csv to .bib files

Having spent hours trying to import a .csv file into [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/), I finally found [Tellico](http://tellico-project.org/). This can convert .csv to .bib files, with no problem. 

 1. First, import the .csv, assigning fields etc. 
 2. Convert to a bibliography (under Collections), and then
 3. export as bibtex and read into your favourite reference manager!
