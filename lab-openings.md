### Graduate Students

F&ES has an excellent [joint PhD program](https://environment.yale.edu/doctoral/degrees/joint-nybg/) with New York Botanical Garden.

In my current non-ladder faculty position, I am unable to directly supervise PhD students, but can co-advise if they are registered with ladder faculty. 

I am able to directly advise Masters students in the MESc and MFS programs, as well as advise MEM and MF students.

The qualities I look for in graduate students include: highly motivated to pursue answers to outstanding questions in ecology and evolution, an integrative research approach, ability to learn and train themselves, good quantitative, analytical, reasoning, writing and editing skills.

Facilities in the School and other Departments are good for conducting lab, greenhouse, field or computer-based approaches.

If you are interested in pursuing graduate work in my lab, please email a statement of your research interests and a CV/Resume that gives your educational background (GPA, relevant biology, math and statistics classes), related work/field/lab experience, publications if any, and GRE scores if available. I will get back to you as soon as I can.

**Before you write to me (or any potential advisor!)** please read and think about the ideas suggested in the following links:

### Undergraduate students
I encourage sincere, hardworking and motivated undergraduate students to actively participate in research projects or to conduct their own independent research. Please see [here](http://www.simonqueenborough.com/people.html) for undergraduates who have worked in the lab.

If you are interested in gaining practical experience in ecology and evolution and you are interested in the research described on this website, please contact me to discuss possibilities. Please include details of the courses you have taken/are taking, current GPA, etc.

The [Yale Tropical Resources Institute](http://environment.yale.edu/tri/fellowships/) has some funding available for senior thesis work.
