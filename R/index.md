Introduction to R
=================

## Objectives

1. Become familiar with R, importing and exporting data and the various forms of data.
2. Become confident using R for the management, description, analysis and visualisation of ecological data.
3. Learn best practices of data exploration, analysis and visualisation.
4. Become confident to keep learning R and where to get help.

## What is R?

First, read this New York Times [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all).

Then, watch these online videos: [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2GZFeYGU3s), and Parts 
 - [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2u7kbcXI_k&feature=related),

 - Install [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) on your laptop.

 ... And get ready for some gRRRReat fun!


## Teaching and Learning Style

This graduate seminar will provide an overview and introduction to the statistical software R. Class time will primarily be used for working through examples and problems as a class or individually. The only way to improve and feel comfortable in R is to use it frequently and regularly.

We will move through topics in the following sequence over the next seven weeks. How long we spend on each section depends how comfortable everyone is. Reading and problems will be assigned in class, on the course website, and via email each week.


### Week 1: 16 Oct 2013 | basic

#### Intro to R, overview, guided session, example problems.
