### Introduction to R

We teach an Introduction to R course, covering basic to advanced programming and statistics in [R](www.r-project.org). We have taught four courses so far:

 - Quito, Ecuador. January 2010
 - Bangalore, India. August 2010
 - Beijing, China, October 2010
 - Columbus, USA Spring Quarter 2012

This will be taught this coming semester (AU13): [Announcement](intro-r.html)


### EEOB Graduate seminar: data to paper

</p>

In this seminar, [Dr. Comita](http://lizacomita.weebly.com/) and I are using existing data from the [Powdermill Nature Reserve](http://www.carnegiemnh.org/powdermill/index.html) in PA (directed by EEOB alumnus Dr. John Wenzel) to generate hypotheses, data analyses and manuscripts for publication. Sub-groups are investigating functional traits, phylogeny, beta-diversity and ecosystem services.

### Biology 1114: Form, Function & Ecology

</p>
Students are trained to think like scientists. Interpret data, design experiments, and develop skills that will enable them to continue learning and thinking long after finishing the course. This is achieved using a blend of readings, quizzes, continuous assessment, in-class activities and discussions.

**Content:** Evolution, Diversity of Life, Organismal Form and Function, Population and Community Ecology, Nature of Biological Science and Society.

**Skills:** Critical Thinking, Developing and Testing Hypotheses, Learning How to Learn, Active Learning.


### Tropical Ecology Field Course, Panama

</p>

Fifteen days, 15 students, four habitat types, one canal.

Students learn practical scientific skills of experimental design, execution and presentation, basic identification and taxonomy, and experience a number of different cultures and ecosystems, as well as interacting with world-class scientists in the [Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute](http://www.stri.si.edu/).


### Dissemination
The science we do must be relevant to society, but to do this it must be communicated well. It is a sad fact that scientific illiteracy is common, but many of the world's problems can be addressed by science and the scientific method. Within academia, this issue can be addressed by high quality training of science students, and I have written a number of resources (Queenborough 2011a,b,c 2012 Bulletin of the British Ecological Society) that discuss various skills such as writing and time management that are often not explicitly taught (these articles, along with a several by other members, will be published by the British Ecological Society as a Handbook).

I am also preparing a number of the case studies that I developed for Bio1114 for submission to the [National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science](http://libweb1.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/) as peer-reviewed case studies.
